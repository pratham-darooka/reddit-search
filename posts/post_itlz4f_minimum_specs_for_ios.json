Taking a comparison b/w an average Android and your 6s, I think that should be perfectly fine.\n\nI honestly recommend that you should upgrade your phone some day, I experienced high device heat when playing AoV on a 6s, so I switched to Oppo A83, which is perfectly fine so far.", "\u201c(Updated May 2020) For iOS devices, we're aiming to have Wild Rift run on iPhone 6 and later.\u201d\n\n[here](https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/en-sg/)", "We have the same phone, and i made the same exact post but didn\u2019t get any attention on it hahah", "I think it's just the CBT for iOS to test their system's stability on iOS. Since the min specs for Android is lower compared to 6s, we might get some hopes.", "Honestly, I have been thinking of upgrading my phone. However, considering the newest iPhone SE's screen is a bit too small for mobile gaming while iPhone 11's screen is not really suitable for MOBA games due to the appearance of the notch, I still don't want to upgrade at all. I might wait for a bigger screen version of SE which will be perfect for Wild Rift.", "Relieved to hear that, thanks for the info. I'm in the region that could participate in the CBT so I'm so hyped for it now.", "Same here. Fellow iOS user too and I hope I get an invite. Good luck! Here\u2019s hoping you get that invite as well"]}
