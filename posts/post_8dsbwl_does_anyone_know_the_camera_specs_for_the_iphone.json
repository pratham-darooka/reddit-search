I'm doing motion tracking and need to fill out the sensor and lens part.\n\n[See here](https://imgur.com/a/Bbce5ZF)", "post_comments": ["Do you know if it was shot with the standard or zoom cameras? I've never used an iPhone so idk if that's info they tell you but the sensors/lenses are different for each.\n\nHere's the DXOMARK page for the iPhone 7  https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-7-plus-camera-review-tested-new-dxomark-mobile-protocol/\n\nIf you don't want to read that here are the key bits of info. \n\nThe standard  is a 1/3 inch sensor and the lens has an aperture of f1.8 and is a 28mm equivalent. \n\nAnd the zoom is a 1/3.6 inch sensor and with an aperture of f2.8 and is a 56mm equivalent. \nCheers!
