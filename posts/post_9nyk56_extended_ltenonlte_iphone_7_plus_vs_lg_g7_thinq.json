What is it that I'm overlooking that would explain why the LG would get so much more extended LTE coverage than my iPhone?", "post_comments": ["Your location maybe helpful to someone trying to answer the question. ", "I\u2019ve wondered this myself. When using android in my area (Arkansas) Verizon shows up as roaming and counts against the roaming limit. I swapped my android for an iPhone it shows up as 3G extended but data doesn\u2019t work very well. Nothing like my Verizon phone on 3G. Depending on your area it could be US Cellular territory. I\u2019ve seen both LTE and 3G from them when i go back to Missouri. I haven\u2019t figure out what the trick is though. As good as their network is I feel like it should just switch to LTE. Either way you have a great question. I wish I knew the answer.", "\nHave questions on phone compatibility or bringing your current phone to Sprint? See Sprint's **[Bring Your Own Phone](http://www.sprint.com/landings/bring-your-own-phone/)** page for a list of eligible devices and for how to purchase a **SIM kit**. For certain devices, you may have to request your ESN be added via DNA2 or a ClickIt Ticket at a Retail Store. Also see the **[Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/wiki/index#wiki_switching_to_sprint/)**.\n\n**Note: Sprint's system does *not* use IMEIs, it uses the device MEID. This is usually the IMEI without the last digit.** If you are encountering an error when trying to use an IMEI, remove the last digit. This is the basis of *a lot* of \"errors\" people seem to be getting. ***There is no error.*** You're trying to use the wrong device identifier. An IMEI is 15 digits long, but an MEID is only 14 digits.\n\nNote, you will *not* experience full speeds/coverage when using devices which lack full LTE Band support, Carrier Aggregation support or HPUE support on Sprint. For reference, Sprint utilizes LTE Bands 25, 26, and 41.\n\nDo you have a new compatible device you want to swap to? **[Activate it here](http://www.sprint.com/landings/howtoactivate/index.html)**.\n\nThe **[My Sprint](https://www.sprint.com/landings/my-sprint-mobile/index.html)** App is available for **[iOS Devices on the App Store](https://appsto.re/us/c0FrD.i)** and for **[Android Devices on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sprint.care)**.
