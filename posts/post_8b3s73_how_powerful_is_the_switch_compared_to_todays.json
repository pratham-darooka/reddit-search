But regardless of what it's classified as, it's insides share home with the tablet family.\n\nSo how does this system compare to today's phones and tablets? Is my Galaxy S8 more powerful?", "post_comments": ["The Switch CPU is pretty far behind smartphones, particularly those from Apple. It's based on the 2014 A57 architecture which was ARM's first stock 64 bit design. There have been three new designs from ARM since then, the A72, A73, and A75. Each generation brought a large increase in performance while also lowering power-draw from the previous. A73 is what went into most 2017 phones using the Snapdragon 835, and now we're seeing A75 in Snapdragon 845 phones. Apple crafts their own custom CPU designs, although still fundamentally based on ARM. The A72/A73/A75 cores used in modern smartphones can offer up to 2-3x performance over the low clocked A57 Nintendo is using, and you can add another 2X on top of those for Apple's chips. So if you have a 2016 phone or beyond, you can expect about 2-3x the CPU performance. There just isn't any competition here, the Switch gets smoked in the CPU department.\n\nThe GPU side of things is a little more forgiving. The Maxwell based GPU inside Tegra X1 was and still is rather unique in the mobile space, as it's the same exact architecture Nvidia uses in their PC gaming cards. The GPU was way ahead of anything else that was available in mobile chips at the time it released in 2015. By 2016 the gap narrowed significantly, and by 2017 most flagship mobile GPUs (Apple A11, Snapdragon 835) had surpassed the Tegra X1 in benchmarks. Nintendo has their Tegra X1 downclocked below the stock speeds nvidia originally shipped it at however, so theres a good chance high end phones in 2015 would've been on par. Either way, while the GPU has been surpassed by modern phones from 2017 and beyond, it's not nearly as far behind as the CPU is.\n\nWe'll still see some good performance from Switch, generally beyond what many phones can do even today, due to the closed nature of the console. Unlike phones, It doesn't have a heavy operating system to manage in the background and can devote the vast majority of it's resources to running games, allowing developers to squeeze out every drop of power in a way they can't do on smartphone/tablet hardware. The Switch also has active cooling via a fan, so developers can expect a completely consistent level of performance 100% of the time while running their software, vs phones which have to throttle their clockspeeds after a few minutes of gameplay due to heat buildup. This throttling can bring you from far-beyond-Switch performance, right on down to Switch-equivalent performance, and potentially down into lower-than-Switch performance depending on the device after just a few minutes. This makes it very hard to push the envelope on mobile devices as you don't have a guaranteed level of performance to work with, and as a result you often have to develop well below the power envelope you initially seem to have. ", "Keep in mind that no matter how much more powerful the phones are, without a dedicated fan to cool them they can't run at peak performance for longer than 5 minutes.", "I'd imagine latest phones / tablets are more powerful on paper, but since it's not a dedicated game console it doesn't take full advantage of power for gaming. \n\nThey cost 2-3x as more than a switch so for that money they better be more \"powerful\"", "Yes, the S8 is more powerful. It might throttle a bit, but I'm not really finding good reviews saying one way or the other. It sounds like the CPU is very stable and doesn't throttle, but of course we need to know about the GPU too and I'm not seeing any good info on that.", "The Switch\u2019s CPU is pretty bad compared to today smartphones and tablets and for the GPU it depends on whether you\u2019re looking at it while docked or not. While docked the Switch\u2019s GPU is about on par with an iPhone 7 and while handheld it\u2019s about on par with an iPhone 6.", "The switch is weaker than all of the current gen high end phones and tablets, its using a slowed down version of the Tegra chip that came out 2 generations ago.\n\nThe thing is that you can't get these same games on iOS or Android so it doesn't matter in the end anyway, but if you're asking could your S8's processor/GPU run Switch games better than the Switch can if it were able to run the Switch OS and the game then the answer is yes.", "In the end it really doesn't matter, because your phone and the Switch are designed to be totally different things.

", "When are people going to realize the Switch is a game console and not a smartphone?", "I don't really know where it stands when compared with the latest smartphone but If I had to guess I would say the Switch is more powerful.\n\nThe reason I say this is because most phone games look terrible compared to what the Switch has come out with", "Phones and tablets are designed for general purpose use, the Switch is a dedicated gaming device first, and a media device second. As far as power, obviously the more recent hardware will be more powerful than hardware that is a few years old. The Switch is based on Maxwell (750 Ti, and the 800-900 series), and being a mobile device, it's power is comparable to a mobile GeForce 900 series card.\n\n\nAs far as performance is concerned, various tests put it around the one teraflop. By comparison, the XBO, I believe, is 1.6 Teraflops (I believe the Xbox One X is rated at 6 teraflops, but I can't be too sure). Flop in this context refers to how fast it floating point operations can be performed, which is a better measurement of relative performance when compared to clockspeeds. To be frank, I really wouldn't begin worrying until we start seeing games releasing exclusively for the XBO X and PS4 Pro, unless Nintendo does a hardware refresh like they did with the New 3DS. The refreshed Switch, if it does come out this year or next year, will likely be Pascal based, I doubt they'll do Volta. I wouldn't get your hopes up about getting a performance boost like what we saw between the PS4 and PS4 Pro, even though Pascal is extremely efficient, the compact nature of the Switch will make cooling somewhat of a challenge, and there's also the matter of power delivery while on battery.", "Well I can play Doom on my Switch and not on my phone. So. Considerably more powerful. ", "Get wrekt", "This was very interesting to read and well written, thanks a lot.", "Just got off work.

Isn't the dock just making it plugged to an outlet and an HDMI source? ", "Not really. The s8 is going to throttle after a few minutes and your going to run into ram issues", "That's pretty much the question at hand.", "Well, it likely could actually.

You\u2019re not paying for ghz you;re paying for \u201cswitch\u201d games you simply wont get elsewhere ", "> When I see an S8 running Doom and BOTW I will believe. But you will never see that.\n\nOf course we'll never see that, but that has nothing to do with power, the S8 is more powerful than the Switch, however BotW won't make it to phones because obviously it's a Nintendo exclusive and Doom won't make it because the economics of the mobile market don't make projects like that sustainable.\n\n> Phones/Tablets are overpriced pieces of shit.

However, 300$ for the Switch, and it was called overpriced.\n\nIt's all about priorities, my $1000 tablet is a vital professional tool that helps me make more money, my $300 switch, however, just plays games. Some people may be totally okay spending $1000 on something that makes them more money, but not be okay spending $300 on something that won't, and to those people, it's logical for them to conclude the Switch is overpriced.\n\nJust because *you* wouldn't do anything other than whatsapp and facebook on a $1000 tablet doesn't mean everyone only does whatsapp and facebook on $1000 tablets.", "I have both.", "Well, PUBG Mobile looks like shit but runs well, meanwhile the One runs it with better graphics but shit framerate.", "The S8 is $587, not a grand.", "Before getting my switch I did a reasonable amount of gaming on iOS and whilst most titles are Free2Play shit-heaps, there were some decent games.\n\nMy single biggest frustration with mobile gaming though are the controls!

I won\u2019t lie, I was mildly disappointed and even somewhat surprised to see an off-the-shelf 2015 Tegra X1 inside the Switch by the time it launched. Nvidia was talking about the Tegra X2 (codename Parker at the time) all through 2016 and had it available for purchase, at the same price as TX1, right around the time Switch launched. \n\nUnlike their previous Tegra chips, TX2 wasn\u2019t a huge departure from TX1 and seemed to mostly smooth out some of TX1\u2019s pain points. Namely, it brought a 2x boost in CPU performance, a 2x boost in GPU performance, double the memory bandwidth, and it pulled this all off while also lowering power draw somewhat compared to TX1. All things that would\u2019ve directly benefitted the Switch both as a portable experience as well as a docked one. (especially that memory bandwidth boost, the real Achilles heel of the Switch as it exists today) In fact it\u2019s so oddly similar to TX1, right down to being identical in size and pin layout for \u201cdrop in compatibility\u201d that it almost seems like it was designed for the Switch as it doesn\u2019t have any other application beyond a developer board to buy off of nvidia\u2019s website. It\u2019s possible Nvidia was asking extra for it that Nintendo decided not to pay, or perhaps yields weren\u2019t up to what Nintendo wanted. We\u2019ll probably never know, but a TX2 Switch would\u2019ve been a real showstopper and could\u2019ve closed the gap between Switch and the latest smartphones, even bringing it closer to base PS4/XB1 for ports. ", "To be fair though, most flagship phones only cost about $250-350 to make, which isn't much more than what the Switch costs to make. \n\nPhones cost that much more because people are will to spend that much more on phones, not because they're that much more expensive to actually make.", "The Odin handheld. You predicted the future", "If a developer were to specifically target the A11 chip inside iPhone 8/8+/X then yes, there is more GPU power and drastically more CPU power available than the Switch has. Realistically though, most developers are targeting the widest range of chips they can within iOS devices. They don't want to make a game that only runs on the very latest hardware, but one that can run as far back as the A7 from 2013. The A11 will run those games much better of course in terms of resolution and framerate (as long as the developer uncaps resolution/framerate from their base target, not all do even when running on better hardware), but they won't be pushing the envelope of what the hardware can do.\n\nWith the Switch, there is one single SoC that every Switch on the market has, all running at the same clockspeeds. Other than having to accommodate the halved GPU performance you get in handheld mode vs docked mode, they can push the Switch to it's limits and optimize for the best performance on just one single configuration knowing that *every* Switch will be able to achieve that same performance. With that said, if there *was* a developer crazy enough to target only the very latest iPhone hardware, they absolutely could achieve much better results than what the Switch can pump out at it's max limits. In 2-3 years we'll see developers targeting A10 or A11 as their baseline (since the future A12/A13/A14 will be in hundreds of millions of devices by then) and we'll finally see what the A11 in iPhone X is fully capable of. ", "While docked the Switch doubles it\u2019s GPU clock speed.", "It's designed first and foremost towards playing games. Nintendo and Nvidia have worked on the tools towards making the engines and games being able to draw out all the power on the console.\n\nHowever, the iPhones and most Android phones aren't designed towards being all-purpose minicomputer devices. They're not geared towards playing games. For example, having multiple games open, a possibility on the phone systems - as they're able to maintain multiple applications open - makes it lose part of the computing power.\n\nLet's say we have a phone with the same specs as the Switch. The amount of computing power available outside the game for the phone has to be bigger than the one on the Switch as the Switch doesn't have to be able to use as many functions. There is also the thing of tinkering the game to use effectively all the power, which is something the devs can do when they only have to ensure the game works on a specific device. However, it's not the same as to making it work on multiple devices - like in the iOS, Android or even the PC spheres. PCs usually compensate that with sheerpower (that's why they can cost even more that US$2,000), whereas the iPhones/iPads and Android phones and tablets can't work as well.", "The key when comparing to phones is the thermal throttling and battery. An S8 doesn't have enough cooling to run at full power for long, but just short bursts where you might be using too many apps at once, for example. Rest of the time it will actually run at even lower clocks than the Switch does, and just scale frequencies dynamically. And, just downclock rapidly and harshly if it heats up too much, because it lacks a fan or any active cooling to rely on.\n\nWhich means that you might get to run a Switch game decently until the thing got too hot, then it would quickly start dropping frames like they are hot.\n\nAlso, good luck getting 30 minutes of playtime out of its battery.", "You want to convince me that all those people buying IPHONE X for 1000$ make money off it?\nYou are reaching here.", "I think mobile looks good.

Nintendo even uses the same \"Erista\" codename the Tegra X1 had to denote their chip in the Switch OS files. Chances are when they use the nomenclature \"custom\" they're simply referring to the fact that the chip is running at different clockspeeds from the Tegra X1 that nVidia first shipped in the 2015 Shield TV. Nintendo's X1 runs about 50% slower on the CPU (1GHz vs 2GHz) and about 30% slower on the GPU (768MHz docked vs 1GHz stock, 307MHz portable).

If you are comparing two handheld devices, the phone can compete really well, especially if it could be told to run at a slower speed to not generate too much heat just like the Switch does.", "And many would say that $300 is too much to spend on games. Turns out that different people have different values for different things. Funny how that works.", "Not only is that completely irrelevant, but you think spending more than $100 on a phone is too much?", "but is it a phone? its actually a personal computing device, the modern ones have 4k screens on them, pretty damn good cameras (not dslr level, but those tend to cost more than $1k without any of the other advantages), they can play games, run word processors, create multitrack music, they aren't far off from doing NLVE, and can already do fairly decent though feature poor image editing...  your phone is probably the single most important device you will own outside of a car or home... I love my switch and all, but lets not pretend smart phones aren't ridiculously important to our modern lives.  Hell without a smart phone I couldn't use moviepass... and I save probably $40 a month on that AT LEAST..... over the 2 year typical phone life that is $960... and as many others have said here, $1000 is the very very top end of phones out now, you can get a good recent flagship device for $600 or so, a decent high midranger (like a one plus) for about $450 and a true midranger for about $300... probably running a screen with twice the resolution of the switch's btw.\n\nAlso your overly defensive stance against people who thought $300 was too much for the switch comes , imo from a total lack of understanding of those people...  when the switch was announced and priced I know many people who reallyw anted nintendo to succeed, the $300 is too much thing was less about their own pocketbooks, and more about them wanting nintendo to be more aggressive after the failure of the wii u... it is the same reason people get annoyed when games they don't even care about keep getting announced for 3ds...  they want to the 3ds in the rearview mirror so that the focus can be on switch moving forward... they don't want nintendo or others doing anything that can be seen as an excuse for the system's failure... thankfully, the system is selling very well... just understand that many who complained about the price weren't opposed to paying it, they just were worried others wouldn't, and as such the system wouldn't be supported, and then they would get shit system support AGAIN, like they did on the wii u.", "That too ", "Now you\u2019re just delving into useless semantics.", "You said:\n\n>\tIt runs 40% less in handheld mode.\n\n40% less than 768 is 460.8 which is 60% of 768.\n\nThe Switch runs at 40% of 768 (~307), which is 60% less.", "If something is $10 and it is 10% off, how much does it cost? Is it $9 or $1?", "Oh, that! \n\nWell, it still can't because the games aren't available on it, and because it would outright stop working after 5 minutes, which is not acceptable at all. So yeah.", "300 dollars is the average price for new consoles no way around it", "In this case, it actually does make a difference, because the default clock speed matters. A chip that runs at x speed and downclocks means that the system has a baseline thermal threshold for x. Downclocking that speed is within the thermal threshold specs for the system. \n\nThe other scenario, where a system has a baseline of x and doubles in power, means that the system now could (possibly) be running at a thermal temp that the system was never designed to handle.\n\n", "something, something, moving goal posts.", "Hence why I said \u201cit *likely* could\u201d", "And 600 dollars is an average price for that type of phone. Neither of these statements invalidate the fact that some will find these prices worth it while others won't.", "Which, in the context of the discussion, is useless semantics."]}
