Samsung offers a sort of cursive font, which I dislike greatly, makes the font ugly in my opinion. When referring to stock vs stock, I can hardly tell the difference. ", "I don't know if you missed where I mentioned that I agreed with you that it does do more work at a higher resolution. All I'm trying to say is that the difference on a modern phone like the Note 7 and the iPhone 7 between loading 720p image and a Quad HD image is so minimal it wouldn't be noticeable (even if it is 4x bigger). Also, most applications do not have a full screen loading image unless it's a game. This is also assuming that the image is actually at the resolution of the phone, and not smaller and blown up to fit. So for other applications, it's simply loading UI elements which are far less taxing. While I'm going to agree with you that there will be a difference, you won't notice it.", "Regardless, Android still isn't the problem here. Regardless, it's the storage shipped with the Android devices.", "Production capacity may be a problem. Apple sells a shitload of phones. ", "$200 at Costco yesterday, $250 all over online.  Your box is still missing software, but I'm sure you'll find some way to install it 'free'.\n\nBut again, we're still talking apples and oranges.  My argument is that running the exact same hardware, consoles usually have better performance.  I'm not arguing that you can't get a 'console-killer' for $300 or less.", "flame war? lol what?\n\nwhy does the surface have a stylus?  its for content creators and professionals...\n\napple included it because that whole segment was was going to surface because the \"ipad is just a big iphone and not a pc replacement\"\n\nwho are you kidding with your comment.  this is what it is, if anyone sounds like a fanboy who hasnt done any research its you\n\n", "People buying burner level android phones are typically not the ones touting how good Androids are compare to iOS. On the other hand, flagship doesn't mean it's the best phone, or even the most expensive phone (Nexus, OnePlus, etc), people pick the phone w/ their personal need; some want larger screen, some want better camera, some want expandable storage or removable battery, some need dual sim. Telling someone who only care about battery life that your camera is better doesn't mean one bit to them.", "I suppose if that's a big factor for you. \n\nAnd what you described is what I described earlier, Prestige Pricing. My point about that is flagship Android devices cost the same amount as iPhones cost. Doesn't make one not premium, they are both premium devices. ", "why are you here", "Yeah I haven't heard of this issue until you brought it up. And if you want something that you don't need to tweak at all, you should consider looking into Nexus devices. They are pure Google devices and don't require any tweaking. ", "The \"exact same hardware\" doesn't exist. Any reasonable person would not buy it. Your argument is just bad. Windows 10 keys come cheap. I normally pay $20 for a valid key and almost anyone with a .edu account can get a free copy. There are thousands of people breaking Apple's EULA and running El cap and the like on custom hardware. Apparently because apple stopped selling their OS it's OK. I don't have a problem with it. I had a perfect hackintosh until I decided OS X is terrible on the desktop without a touchpad and installed Windows 10. Windows 10 has it's problems but at least I can play games occasionally.", "And now you're finally understanding why people buy iPhones. \n\nBecause normal people, most people, don't care too much about one specific feature. They want a good *phone*. All around. Which is why they buy iPhones. Yes, specific androids may have better cameras, screens, or battery lives. iPhone does very well in all three. \n\nJack of all trades, master of none. ", "Price alone doesn't make a device \"premium\". It's a mixture of all those factors. Many of which give Apple the advantage over Samsung. \n\nI know exactly what a prestige buyer is, being one myself. No one looking for that prestige factor is going to buy an Android phone. ", "Because this is the Apple subreddit and not the iPhone subreddit. I'm literally typing this comment on my Macbook Pro.", "Given that I'm perfectly happy with what I have, that's not going to happen, though", "Oh no I always understand why people buy iPhones. I typically recommend it when someone not interested in anything specific or someone like my parents ask me what phone to buy. \n\nThat said, I think any flagship Android today, S7/Edge, HTC10, G5, Nexus 6P, does well in all three those areas. And Samsung is actually the master of screen and camera right now.\n\nAnother huge advantage of iPhone is how the updates are pushed directly by Apple and not through carriers. Most Android phones these days get screwed over by carrier bloat and slow updates, sometimes months after Google makes them available.", "That would be a matter of preference. Try the folks over at /r/Android they will think differently. I found the S7 edge to be more prestigious than my 6s plus for example. It's a matter of personal opinion/preference. You cannot generalize. ", "No, it's not. The people over at /r/Android are wrong. \n\n> I found the S7 edge to be more prestigious than my 6s plus for example. \n\nHahaha my sides! I mean, if you think a copycat phone is more prestigious, you need to reexamine the devices and come to the proper conclusion. ", "I think you need to redefine what you consider prestigious my friend. If you think the build design alone makes something prestigious, your definition of prestige and the majority of other people's definition will vary. ", "> I think you need to redefine what you consider prestigious my friend.\n\nI'm pretty sure you don't get any more prestigious than an Apple product. It's the most popular phone in areas with lots of wealth, it's always front and centre every year, they're the number 2 watch brand under Rolex, and so forth. If they make a car you can be damn sure it's not gonna be cheap, but I would consider Tesla a prestige buy right now. ", "Apple products do have prestige, don't get me wrong I have an iPad, MacBook, and an iPhone that I use constantly. Additionally, I am using the Apple TV as well as using an Apple router. I have been using Apple for years I know they do carry prestige. I don't think that Samsung phones for example are not prestigious phones, as their flagships cost the same as an Apple device. So in your theory, that must make it prestigious. \n\nI would like to see some statistical proof for Apple being the most popular phone in areas of lots of wealth. I grew up in Chicago and have been living by the South Side for some time (moved due to college), and you can find just as much iPhones in the hands of the lower income class as you would with any other area. Same with Samsung devices. I have seen a fair amount regardless of socioeconomic class.\n\nIf you actually think Apple watches carry any prestige, I will laugh at you. Rolex, Tag, Omega, Patek Philippe, etc are all examples of prestigious watches. I don't think most people wear an Apple Watch thinking it is some prestigious time piece. Tell this to anyone in the watch community and they will laugh at you.\n\nAs for Tesla, I wouldn't call it a prestige buy. My reason is that they are the pinnacle of performance electric car innovation. There are virtually no other brands that manufactures performance electric cars like Tesla does. BMW launched the i8 some time ago, but that is far more expensive than you could get a Tesla for. Using your logic, the Tesla wouldn't be a prestige buy, the BMW i8 would be a prestige buy because it costs more."]}
