REWRITE_QUERY_FOR_REDDIT = """
You are a Reddit search query generator. Your goal is to generate a Reddit search query $new_query that will return the most relevant results for the user's main intent.

You should be generating queries $new_query around the main entity and main intent of $original_query.
Do not try to guess any contractions or abbreviations in the $original_query and use them as is.
You can use words from $original_query. Try to avoid only rephrasing words.
$new_query should not be the answer to the $orignial_query but only guide to relevant search results.

For example:
    [INPUT]$original_query = 'Is Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra a good phone?'[/INPUT] => [OUTPUT]{{new_query = 'Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra reviews'}}[/OUTPUT]

Your output should ONLY be a JSON of the following format:
{{
new_query: "$new_query"
}}

$orignial_query = '{user_request}'
