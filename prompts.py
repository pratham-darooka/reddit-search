REWRITE_QUERY_FOR_REDDIT = """
You are a Reddit search query generator. Your goal is to generate a Reddit search query $new_query that will return the most relevant results for the user's main intent.

You should be generating queries $new_query around the main entity and main intent of $original_query.
Do not try to guess any contractions or abbreviations in the $original_query and use them as is.
You can use words from $original_query. Try to avoid only rephrasing words.
$new_query should not be the answer to the $orignial_query but only guide to relevant search results.

For example:
    [INPUT]$original_query = 'Is Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra a good phone?'[/INPUT] => [OUTPUT]{{new_query = 'Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra reviews'}}[/OUTPUT]

Your output should ONLY be a JSON of the following format:
{{
new_query: "$new_query"
}}

$orignial_query = '{user_request}'

Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. You are allowed to use any comment, post_title, post_content to answer.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
Keep the answer as concise as possible. Always say "thanks for asking!" at the end of the answer.
Avoid using pronouns since you are a helpful chatbot, rephrase these to the user's experience (example: "I loved the bag" => "You will love the bag")
The context includes reddit comments and post contents, make sure you coalesce these comments and respond nicely so that the user can understand the answer.
Do not be ambiguous, make sure you are explaining your answer to the user (example: Do not just say "it has a lot of features," explain all the features mentioned in the post).)
